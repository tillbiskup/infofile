# Contributing

Due to its permissive BSD license, you are free to use and further develop the Infofile format for your own purposes. However, any feedback will be greatly appreciated. To coordinate development, cloning the repository and providing pull requests is strongly encouraged.

The current reference implementation of the Infofile parser is part of the [ASpecD framework](https://github.com/tillbiskup/aspecd). Development of the templates for specific methods will always be closely connected to the respective data model, e.g. in context of the [trepr](https://github.com/tillbiskup/trepr) and [cwepr](https://github.com/tillbiskup/cwepr) Python packages.
